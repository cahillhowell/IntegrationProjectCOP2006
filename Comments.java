/**
 *	This class will just be comments, talking about how I will be planning out lines of code and a simple small
 *	testing area
 *
 * last part of the integration milestones,
 * Effectively utilize exception handling for user input of an int
 * 
 * just ask tomorrow in class if my else error code in loops is worthy of that, because it is stopping
 * the code from being erroneous 
 * 
 * example of 1D array
 * 
 * 	int[] a=new int[3];//declaration   
	a[0]=10;//initialization  
	a[1]=20;  
	a[2]=30;  
	//printing array  
	System.out.println("One dimensional array elements are");    
	System.out.println(a[0]);    
	System.out.println(a[1]);    
	System.out.println(a[2]);
